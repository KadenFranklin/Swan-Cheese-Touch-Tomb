a game for https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci370/


Name: Swan-Escape

Intent: To develop survival skills

Narrative Structure: 

Mechanics: The player moves around as though they are a fish, avoiding dangerous predators such as swans.

Aesthetics: Many of the graphics are low-poly meshes that follow a similiar style. (With exception of the swan.)

joys and struggles while writing this game: Collisions are hard, animating things is fun.

a paragraph discussing the contributions of each team member to the final game:

Kaden Franklin - I did a little bit of the asset collecting, I found the swan mesh and the tiles and environment. I implemented the swan, and set up most of the environment except for the cave.  I also gave the swan its movement, and made the fish rotate, to appear as though its swimming underwater. I tried to implement physics, but the collisions don't seem to work.

Miguel Velazquez - I found the audio and the fonts for the game. I made the start and credit scenes, as well as the script that loads them in. I also corrected the .gitignore when it wasn't working properly in the beginning. I tried to make the caustics work for the water, but those attempts failed. I gathered the scripts needed for the steering. I corrected some small bugs in the scripts as well.
